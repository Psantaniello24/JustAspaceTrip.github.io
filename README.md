Just a space trip is a one level game (for the moment ) , created from scratch , that projects you into a collapsed 
space environment , where multiple copies of planets and stars were created by the One-Eye monster , that simply looks at you 
while you try to not collide with all the elements in the game .

USER INTERACTIONS :

To pass the level(and win the game) you have to reach the black hole at the end of the scene , without colliding with any element such as stars , metheoras and copy of planets .  If you collide, the the 'game over' scene will appear (also triggering the sound of an explosion) , while if you you are able to reach the black hole , you will see the 'you-win' scene .

To restart the game just reload the page .

At the start , you have to wait while the model is loaded, that usually doesn't take a lot of time, you can use that time to set diffulty (no-one has ever win the game in hard mode) , and for activating audio.
